# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Trend Summary
* The top 5 preforming schools did not appear to be influenced by the spending per student or the class size. They ranged from 578-638 spent per student and school sizes of 962-2283.

* That being said, the bottom 5 preforming schools did have larger than average budgets per student (ranging from 637-665) and larger student bodies (2917-4761).

* The average passing rate for both reading and math per school largely didn't change more than a percentage point per grade. If a school was making a difference we would expect to see these numbers trending upwards each year but since they are not this seems to suggest that the passing rates of the schools have little to do with anything other than the caliber of students that are admitted to the school.

* As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student actually (645 -675) underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).

* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

* As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
